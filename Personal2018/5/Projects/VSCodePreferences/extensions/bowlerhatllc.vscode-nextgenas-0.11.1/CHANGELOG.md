### Fixed Issues

* asconfigc: Added `ios_simulator` as a new platform in `airOptions`.
* Completion: When using completion to add MXML language tags, like `<fx:Script>` or `<fx:Component>`, the cursor is now correctly placed between opening and closing tags instead of at the end.
* Completion: Fixed issue where triggering the completion list in MXML from an existing prefix would incorrectly omit components if the MXML namespace were defined from a package, like `xmlns:example="com.example.*"`.
* Completion: Fixed issue where an exception was displayed when triggering completion for aattributes on an `<fx:Component>` tag.
* Completion: Changed the "kind" for getters/setters and methods so that the proper icon is displayed in the completion list.

* Tasks: Removed deprecated command "Tasks: Configure Task Runner (ActionScript - asconfig.json)". Use **Configure Default Build Task** in **Tasks** menu instead.
* Tasks: If the Adobe AIR desktop target is set to "native" in *asconfig.json* the list of tasks will specifically mention which tasks will package a native installer.
* Workspace Symbols: Fixed issue where an exception was displayed when listing workspace symbols and a SWC file in the SDK contains resource bundles.

## 0.10.0

### New Features

* Build: *asconfig.json* may optionally include `${flexlib}` token in paths specified in the compiler options. This token will be replaced with the path to the *frameworks* directory of the current SDK. For Apache Royale projects, the `${royalelib}` token is available instead.
* Debugger: When a runtime error is thrown, displays the details inside the editor â€“ directly below the line where the error occurred.
* Debugger: When a runtime error is thrown, the properties of the error object are displayed in the **Variables** view.

* Settings: Fixed issue where a Maven-built distribution of Apache Royale could not be used with the `nextgenas.sdk.editor` setting.
* Syntax Highlighting: Classes and interfaces are now colored differently than keywords, making ActionScript syntax highlighting more consistent with other languages in Visual Studio Code. Additionally, the package name in fully qualified class names is now colored too.

## 0.9.1

### Fixed Issues

* Apache Royale: Updated to search for npm moddules with new names: *@apache-royale/royale-js* and *@apache-royale/royale-js-swf*.

* Completion: Fixed issue where activating completion with `Ctrl+Space` after a partial MXML component name could omit some results due to incorrect case-sensitive comparison.

## 0.9.0

### New Features

* Apache Royale is now supported! The code intelligence features of the ActionScript & MXML extension are now powered by the latest Apache Royale compiler. SWF projects targeting Adobe AIR and Flash Player remain fully suported, but Apache FlexJS projects are considered deprecated, and updgrading to Royale is recommended.

* Editor: When overriding a method, the completion list will suggest method names from superclass that can be overridden.
* Settings: added `nextgenas.asconfigc.useBundled` setting to disable the bundled version of **asconfigc** and use the globally installed npm version, if you prefer.

* Editor: If an MXML tag is unclosed, a suggestion to close it will appear in the completion list.
* Editor: Now supports completion of state names in MXML.
* Editor: Fixed issue where the first import added to a `<fx:Script>` element in MXML would incorrectly be added at the beginning of the file.
* Command: Added "Restart ActionScript/MXML server" command to restart the language server without reloading the entire window.

* Debugging: Source location is shown on the right side of the debug console when a runtime error is thrown and displayed in the console.

### Fixed Issues

* Java Compatibility: Fixed issue where extension would not work correctly with Java 9 because the version string format changed.

## 0.6.0

### New Features

* Code generation: If an unknown method is called, a new code action can generate a new method with that signature.
* Code generation: If an unknown variable is referenced, a new code action can generate a new variable.

## 0.5.1

* Fixed that hover and signature help did not work inside event added to the root element of an MXML component.
* Fixed issue where asconfig.json validation failed to warn if `files` field is missing for application (this field is still optional for a library).
* Fixed issue where searching by workspace symbol would throw error because some files were not opened in the editor.
* Fixed syntax highlighting for `/**/` being incorrectly detected as an asdoc comment, which caused the coloring to extend beyond the `*/` to the following lines.
* Fixed syntax highlighting of single line comments that start at end of the same line as a class, interface, or function declaration.
* Fixed issue where building the vscode-nextgenas extension from source would fail if Adobe dependencies were not already installed with Maven from another project, and updated the build instructions to use settings-template.xml.

## 0.5.0

* SDK version is listed in status bar and you can click it to open a helpful new SDK picker.
* New `nextgenas.sdk.searchPaths` setting allows you to add more SDKs to the SDK picker.
* New "ActionScript Source Path" view lists all classes/interfaces/components available from the `source-path` compiler option.
* The `nextgenas.sdk.editor` setting is now considered advanced, and most users should not need to use it any longer (even when using SDKs other than Apache FlexJS). Simply set `nextgenas.sdk.framework` (or use the new SDK picker) to choose your current project's SDK.
* Changing the `nextgenas.sdk.framework` setting does not require restarting Visual Studio Code anymore.

* Replaced "NextGen ActionScript" icon with a new "AS3" icon.
* SWF debugger: If a source file is not found when trying to add a breakpoint, tries again later when more scripts are loaded. If breakpoints start out unverified, it's possible that they will be verified later when the SWF goes to a new frame.
* SWF debugger: Fixed issue where breakpoints removed in editor were not actually removed in running SWF and would still stop the debugger.
* SWF debugger: Begins executing SWF earlier because breakpoints can now be verified after startup. This may allow preloaders to render properly now (they skipped immediately to the end before).
* Searching workspace symbols simplified to exclude local variables in methods.
* Fixed issue where automatically adding an import would fail if the ActionScript file contained a license header or other comments before the package keyword.
* Fixed issue where some errors caused by invalid compiler options might not be displayed in the problems view.
* Fixed issue where extension could crash when doing certain things without an open workspace. Will now display a warning if certain actions are attempted without an open workspace.

* Fixed issue where the extension could not be used in multiple VSCode windows on Windows 10 because it did not properly detect an open port.
* Fixed issue where package completion on Windows would incorrectly contain backslashes.
* Fixed issue where package completion would not work when file is completely empty and editor is powered by Apache FlexJS 0.8.0 (not fixed with FlexJS 0.7.0, due to bugs in the compiler).

* Added support for the the new `targets` compiler option from Apache FlexJS 0.8 in `asconfig.json`.
